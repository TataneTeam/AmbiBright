AmbiBright
==========

Free Java Ambilight implementation inspired by the Adaligth project (http://learn.adafruit.com/adalight-diy-ambient-tv-lighting)

The implementation is based on below software:

- The RXTX library for communication with the Arduino device (http://rxtx.qbang.org/wiki/index.php/Download)
- The Adalight LEDStram implementation for the Arduino LED management (https://github.com/adafruit/Adalight/tree/master/Arduino/LEDstream)

Usage
-----
Download the [archive](https://github.com/TataneTeam/AmbiBright/archive/master.zip) and extract AmbriBright.jar, AmbiBright.bat and the lib folder somewhere on your computer.
Make sure you have Java installed and it is present in the path (or modify the .bat to specify the full path of the binary).
Double-click the "AmbiBright.bat".

If you are under Windows 32-bits, replace the RXTX lib with the [32-bits](http://rxtx.qbang.org/wiki/index.php/Download).
